# modid-db-sylv

Searches Modrinth and other places for mod IDs and adds them to the mod ID database. This can be used to check if a mod ID has already been taken by another mod.

## TODO

- [ ] Update this README with the details of this action
- [ ] Update inputs/outputs in `action.yaml`
- [ ] Implement the action's logic in `src/main.rs`
- [ ] Rename the default Git branch to `v1` (instead of `main` or `master`. This helps with potential future breaking changes. **PROVIDED ACTIONS WILL NOT WORK UNTIL YOU DO THIS**
